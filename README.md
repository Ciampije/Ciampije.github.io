Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Jquery, and Javascript.

Texas Hold Em is a type of poker game that can be played with multiple people but for this games purposes you are playing a computer 1v1. Each user is given two cards to try and get the best hand along with the five cards flipped on the table. In the first round, or the flop, three cards are flipped and each user has a chance to make a bet. The next round, or the turn, is when one more card is flipped and again, each player can bet. In the final round, or the river, the last card is flipped over and both players bet again. Finally both players flip their own cards over to see who has the best five card hand.
